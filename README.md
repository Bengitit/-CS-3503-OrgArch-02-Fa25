# CS 3503 Assignment 1 - Number Base Conversion

## Author
[ Abass Diaby ]

## Description
This project implements a number base conversion utility for Owl Tech Industries.
It converts unsigned integers into binary, octal, decimal, and hexadecimal using:
1. Division/remainder algorithm (`div_convert`)
2. Subtraction/powers algorithm (`sub_convert`)
3. Bitwise demonstration (`print_tables`)

make sure to install:
main.c
convert.c

## Notes
The most interesting part of this assignment was connecting the convert.c, main.c, and the a1_test file altogether. I'm used to connecting one code and a file in C#, which made this learning process really interesting in how everything connects with one another. The most challenging thing about this assignment was writing the Main. I did a lot of research on how to write the Main since this was new code and I am used to writing in C#. It had a pretty similar approach to how it read the lines in the file, so once I notice the similarites I started to approach it as if I was writing in C#. It was extremely time-consuming since I had never written in C before, so watching some videos about the basics really helped me. One thing I found annoying is that I need to declair methods ahead before using them whenever.
